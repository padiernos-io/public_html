<h2>{% trans %}What does Backstop Generator do?{% endtrans %}</h2>
<p>{% trans %}Backstop Generator greatly simplifies the process of creating BackstopJS files for your Drupal website. Through the module's user interface, you can generate Viewports from all themes with defined breakpoints as well as Scenarios from your menus, content types and paths for all enabled languages. Create multiple Profiles to test specific areas of your site, or create a single Profile to test it all. Or both! Changes you make in the interface will be reflected in the BackstopJS JSON file, and the commands to run in your terminal for each test are provided on the Commands tab.{% endtrans %}</p>

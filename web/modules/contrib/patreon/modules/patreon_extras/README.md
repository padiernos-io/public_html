## SUMMARY

The Patreon Extras module pulls data from the Patreon API and provides it in different formats for use on a Drupal site.

## REQUIREMENTS

The module requires that the Patreon User module is enabled and configured.

If the tokens module is enabled, some API data will be available as global tokens. This relies on users being registered
on your site and connected to patreon by the patreon_user module: this is due to API changes that mean the API no longer
returns pledge data for a campaign. Pledges must now be calculated from the individual user's Patreon accounts. **This
means it is not possible to obtain all pledge data, only the data from users linked to your site.**

## INSTALLATION

The module can be installed as usual; see [https://drupal.org/node/895232](https://drupal.org/node/895232) for further
information. It is a sub-module of the Patreon module.

## CONFIGURATION

There is no configuration for this module.

## CUSTOMIZATION

This module does not currently offer opportunity to customise.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

The data is collected from the API on a daily cron run. If it appears out of date, you will need to trigger cron.
